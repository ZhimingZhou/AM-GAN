# AM-GAN2

This is a clean implementation of AM-GAN.

It also provides modularized implementation of evaluation metrics including AM-Score, Inpcetion-Score and FID, along with a simple yet powerful logger system.

It was written with tensorflow-1.5 and python3.5. You can setting up the required environments according to build_env.sh.

To make it clean and adapt to new version of tensorflow, the network sturctures and hyperparameters are slight different from [AM-GAN](https://github.com/ZhimingZhou/AM-GAN).
