# AM-GAN

This is a clean implementation of AM-GAN. It also provides modularized implementation of evaluation metrics including AM-Score, Inception-Score and FID, along with a simple yet powerful logger system. 

It was written with tensorflow-1.5 and python3.5. You can setting up the required environments according to build_env.sh. Note that the network structures and hyper-parameters are slight different from [AM-GAN](https://github.com/ZhimingZhou/AM-GAN-original).
